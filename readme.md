**Doraemon-Your Personal Assistant**

Recently, I read the book, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" and I was so inspired by it, that I decided to automate the task that I frequently do in my system. After searching for some time on various websites and referring various posts on Linkedin as well, I came up with the idea of my own voice assistant. This voice assistant can:

I) Open Android Studio and Sublime Text for me (these are the IDEs, I use the most).

II) Search anything on Wikipedia.

III) Open Youtube Videos for me.

IV) Search answers to the questions on StackOverflow

V) Search for anything on Google.

Although, what is missing is a nice UI. I will surely try to implement that in the next update.

**How to run this file**

Go to requirements.txt file and install the required external libraries. Then go to assistant.py and run it using the following command:

python3 assistant.py

Always start your command with Open (X- x can Google, Wikkipedia, Youtube , StackOverflow, SublimeText and Android Studio.). However, to run sublime text and Android Studio
you have to change the path in the file and provide your own path.

**I am attaching a video for the reference purpose**

The video is avaiable in the repository. It is named as demo.mp4 . Please check that.
